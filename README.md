# i3-dotfiles

These are my (somewhat broken) dotfiles for the i3 WM. They are made for a laptop so some of the config may be a bit weird for anyone on a desktop. It uses the nord theme for the most part however I'm still working on putting the theme in everything.

## Install

To install them just clone the git repository, you can rename the folder if you want to. Then run the `install.sh` file. The install script is a bit broken, and sometimes not everything works so just keep that in mind.

## Notes
- I switch the caps lock key to be esc/ctrl
- I make escape become caps lock
